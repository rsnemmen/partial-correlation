`cens_tau` was written in 1995 by M. G. Akritas and J. Siebert. 

[Rodrigo Nemmen](https://rodrigonemmen.com) made the code easier to use, with the following improvements: 

- accepts any filename for input data file
 free format input data, allows more freedom with input columns
- outputs the confidence level in standard deviations and the probability (Pnull) with which the null hypothesis can be rejected
